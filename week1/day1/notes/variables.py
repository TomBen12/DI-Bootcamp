#Varibles best practice

#naming a variable in python:

# 1990_year = not allowed

# year_1990 = 67 ok

# @ju = something not allowed

# _my_variable = 'somenting'  allowed, but we avoid if not OOP

# PASSWORD = 'blabla' allowed, but we use for contant values

#multiple words = underscore instead of spaces

# my_score = 10

someVariable = 'just JS'
some_variable = 'This is python'

age = input("How old are you? ")
print(f"You are {age} years old")
